# "Grand Theft Apocalypse" / "Face The Dark"

## Concept
The year is 2021. Approximately 5 years ago an alien super weapon was detonated directly above Los Santos. The effect was immediate and crippling - all electronics were instantly disabled causing cars to stop working and planes to fall from the sky. This was but a first stage of the weapon. In the second stage all vehicles on the streets were lifted high into the air and dumped far out at sea. In the third stage a mysterious virus was released into the air causing all those who it infected to lose control of their body forcing them into a zombie-like state. In the final stage, the sky was tainted black - blocking out the sun and plunging the world into a state of perpetual darkness.

Some, it turned out, are naturally immune to the virus. These few people are all that remain of the world that once existed. They fight each other and the Zeds to survive.

The military response to this attack was slow and cumbersome. Thousands of soldiers died during the initial stages of the weapon and hundreds more were killed by the Zeds and mutated creatures that spawned from the virus. Transmitted by air, the only way the military can protect themselves is to wear breathing apparatus at all times.

While some survivors may be immune to the virus, there are some areas of the world that are too badly infected for even them to go. The subway and sewer system is an example of this. Breathing apparatus must be worn at all times else you will die a most painful death.

Some wildlife seem to be immune to the effects of the virus and can survive even the worst infected areas without problem. However, a lack of food had caused many animals to become aggressive and will attack anything they believe they can eat.

- Spawn special Zeds with extra health, speed, etc (bigfoot, alien)
- Predefined areas where special enemies spawn (alien nests, etc)
